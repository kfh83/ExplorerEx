# ExplorerEx
ExplorerEx is an adaptation of Windows Explorer from Windows Server 2003's source tree, making it independent from Microsoft's archaic build system, whilst also making it function on modern versions of Windows.

The 2000 branch aims to replicate the looks and feel of the Windows 2000 explorer using the Server2k3 codebase.
